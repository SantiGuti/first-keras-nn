# Basic neural network with Keras

This neural network, through MNIST, takes an image and tries to classify it as a digit. Keras is used to create the model and Matplotlib is used to plot the information.

This exercise was done following an article by Victor Zhou. https://victorzhou.com/blog/keras-neural-network-tutorial/
